<h3>What is it?</h3>

Domain driven design is a term that is tossed around in software development circles. It is based on the principles set down by Eric Evans in his book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1331054640&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a>. Thinks to my good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/brycedarling" target="_blank">Bryce Darling</a>, I have been taking a more in depth look at this method of development.

Working in the .NET environment most of the time, along with N-TIER, I see this stuff in action. My experience with PHP however is quite the opposite. There are a lot of application stacks and frameworks that take the cake (laff) as far as patterns go. Domain driven design says keep your domain - that is the "what" of your application - at the center of the application:

<h3>The different layers explained</h3>
It might be helpful to give a brief explanation of what each of these fellas are. I have noticed some of these things up to interpretation, so I would love some feedback if you understand otherwise.

<h4>Domain</h4>
As I stated earlier, the domain is the "what" of your application. If you are making a web application for a veterinarian's office, then your <em>domain</em> models might be: <code>Dog</code>, <code>Cat</code>, <code>Appointment</code>, or <code>Doctor</code>.

<h4>Infrastructure</h4>
Infrastructure is where most of the stuff independent of your application lives. Data persistence, low level loggers, third party libraries, configurations, etc... 

<h4>Application</h4>
The application layer is where the high level stuff goes. You might have services coordinating various objects or some high level logging. The application layer if commonly referred to as the glue.

<h4>Presentation</h4>
This is where the look and feel goes. The cool thing about this layer is you can have multiple presentations that make use of your other layers. You might have a presentation layer that exposes your domain as JSON in a RESTful service, and another one that is your traditional markup and CSS.

<h4>Tests</h4>
Test live on the same layer as your presentation. This is where you would group your unit tests and test related stuff.
