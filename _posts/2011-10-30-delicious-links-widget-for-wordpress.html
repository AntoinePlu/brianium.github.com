<p>We all love to share on the internet. Delicious is a great service for social bookmarking, and I was looking for a way to just display a few of my more recent shares.</p>

<p>Most of the things that came up with a quick search for such a tool involved things like importing Delicious links into your blogroll. I wasn't havin it so I whipped up this simple widget to display a specified amount of your most recent delicious links.</p>

<div class="seven columns alpha">
	<h2>Easy to Setup</h2>
	<p>
	Just place your delicious username and password in the widget and select your count. Done.
	</p>

	<h2>Easy to use</h2>
	<p>
	Just keep on bookmarking, and the delicious links widget will keep up with your most recent shares and display them wherever you decide to place this tasty widget.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="four columns omega">
	<img class="bordered" title="delicious" src="/images/delicious.jpg" width="270" height="292" />
</div>
<hr />
<div class="eleven columns alpha omega">
<p>
	Again any thoughts or feedback would be appreciated.
