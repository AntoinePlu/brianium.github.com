<p>I usually end up having a need for some sort of syntax highlighter on every blog I have ever contributed to. This goes double for my own blog. There are a ton of options out there, and it can make your head spin trying to decide what languages, features, short codes, and chrome spinners you want.</p>

<p>I decided it would be better to just have a small set of functionality from a well established tool. I have always been a fan of the <a target="__blank" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">syntax highlighter by Michael Samuel</a> hosted on Google code.</p>

<p>This plugin is simple. It queues the scripts and style sheets, and it allows you to pick a theme. The usage follows the same rules as if you were using the highlighter any where else. See <a href="http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.html" target="__blanks">here</a> for detailed instructions.</p>

<div class="five columns alpha">
	<h2>Simple Syntax Settings Menu</h2>
	<p>
	Easily switch between themes for the syntax highlighter. Ships with the four themes listed <a href="http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styles/index.html" target="__blank">here</a>. It is also easy to create your own themes. Just place the CSS file and preview thumb in the themes directory of the plugin.
