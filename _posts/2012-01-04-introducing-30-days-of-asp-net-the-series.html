I have always been a fan of series. I think particularly of the "Sessions" you can find on Envato sites like <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com" target="_blank">NetTuts</a>. My main goal creating a series is not just to teach others, but mainly to teach myself. It is a good way to organize goals and document your progress through something. I want to grab a good book or a couple of other resources and just set a goal to finish learning a subject in 10 days, 20 days, a month, etc...

I develop in different areas. I have made applications in ASP.NET, PHP, JSP, Python, and the standard web technologies (JavaScript, CSS, HTML). I have mastered a few, but some feel like a familiarity. I want to visit and revisit, attack and conquer, really broaden my horizons.

In this first series I am going to be going mostly through some screen casts and Imar Spaanjaars' book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-ASP-NET-VB-Wrox-Programmer/dp/0470502215/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1325691572&sr=1-1">Beginning ASP.NET 4: in C# and VB</a> with a special focus on C# as the backbone of my sources for this endeavor.

I will document what I cover - even if it is old hat to me. I'll develop some examples and really dive deep into the framework. Hopefully this will be a good way to reinforce what I do know, master what I don't know, and help others learn in the process.
