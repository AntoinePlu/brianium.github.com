Just wanted to take a minute to update my first series here. Since starting with my first series "30 Days of ASP.NET", I have moved, started a new job, and have started tackling all kinds of new material. It has become abundantly clear, that I no longer have the time to stick to a strict "One-A-Day" schedule, so I have decided to change my original "30 Days of ASP.NET" series to just "<a href="http://www.brianscaturro.com/series/30-days-of-asp-net/" title="The Basics Of ASP.NET" target="_blank">The Basics of ASP.NET</a>". This is a broad category where most of these posts live right now, so it seemed appropriate. I hope to continue adding posts to this series, not only for others to gain, but also for me to continue to reinforce those essentials that come up all the time.
