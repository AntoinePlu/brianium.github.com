<div class="eleven columns">

We all love to share on the internet. Delicious is a great service for social bookmarking, and I was looking for a way to just display a few of my more recent shares.

Most of the things that came up with a quick search for such a tool involved things like importing Delicious links into your blogroll. I wasn't havin it so I whipped up this simple widget to display a specified amount of your most recent delicious links.

</div>

<div class="six columns">
<h4>Easy to Setup</h4>
<p>
Just place your delicious username and password in the widget and select your count. Done. Check out the footer of this site to see it in action.
</p>

<h4>Easy to use</h4>
<p>
Just keep on bookmarking, and the delicious links widget will keep up with your most recent shares and display them wherever you decide to place this tasty widget.

<div class="four columns">
<a href="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/delicious.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-855" title="delicious" src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/delicious.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="292" /></a>
</div>

<div class="eleven columns">

Again any thoughts or feedback would be appreciated.
