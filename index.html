		Why hello there! I am Brian of clan Scaturro - a proud and noble tribe.
	</p>
	<p>
		I suppose I could be called a programmer. I write programs, usually of the web variety. I spend an inordinate amount of time doing such activities...
	</p>
	<p>
		On the off chance that I am not programming or reading about said gramming, I am likely spending time with my beautiful wife and baby boy in the Grandest of Rapids!.
	</p>
	<p>
		I love Jesus.
	</p>
