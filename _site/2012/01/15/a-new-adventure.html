					<h1>A New Adventure<span class="post-date">15 Jan 2012</span></h1>
					I have worked at <a href="http://www.oneupweb.com" target="_blank">Oneupweb</a> for 10 months now. It has been exciting, and I feel that I was able to accomplish quite a bit during my short stay. I have had a chance to work with some clever designers, some brilliant programmers, and some innovative marketers. I have been a part of some really cool projects that support a lot of different aspects of business. I got to be the head code monkey behind Oneupweb's awesome new <a href="http://www.oneupweb.com/rosi/" target="_blank">ROSI trax &reg;</a>. I've gotten to modify and extend open source software to support project management. I've been able to push mobile and start integrating responsive design into some of Oneupweb's <a href="http://www.oneupweb.com/landing/be-found-with-search-engine-mi/" target="_blank">landing pages</a>. It has been an absolute pleasure developing API's to expose data and create SDK's to consume it, all to support this brilliant business in it's endeavors.

I have been extremely blessed to be a part of this company, but opportunity has come-a-knockin, and I just had to open that door. I have accepted a position as an advanced programmer at the <a href="http://www.c2experience.com/" title="The C2 Group" target="_blank">C2 Group</a> in Grandville, MI. Not only will I get to keep developing applications, but there is the added bonus of being closer to family. My wife and I will be living a lot closer to family as we await the birth of our first child.

I will be starting with C2 early next week on Monday the 23rd of January. I have decided to post this here not only to share the good news, but to give notice that I will be taking a tiny break from blogging for a week or so as I get everything in order for the big move. It is my goal to be ready to give 110% and come out of the gate strong at C2.

God has been extremely faithful to me and my family, and we are pumped to be setting out on this new journey He has placed before us.
