			<h1>A New Adventure<span class="post-date">15 Jan 2012</span></h1>
			<p>I have worked at <a href="http://www.oneupweb.com" target="_blank">Oneupweb</a> for 10 months now. It has been exciting, and I feel that I was able to accomplish quite a bit during my short stay. I have had a chance to work with some clever designers, some brilliant programmers, and some innovative marketers.
</p>
<p>
  I have been a part of some really cool projects that support a lot of different aspects of business. I got to be the head code monkey behind Oneupweb's awesome new <a href="http://www.oneupweb.com/rosi/" target="_blank">ROSI trax &reg;</a>. I've been able to modify and extend open source software to support project management. I've been able to push mobile and start integrating responsive design into some of Oneupweb's <a href="http://www.oneupweb.com/landing/be-found-with-search-engine-mi/" target="_blank">landing pages</a>. It has been an absolute pleasure developing API's to expose data and create SDK's to consume it, all to support this brilliant business in it's endeavors.</p>

<p>I have been extremely blessed to be a part of this company, but opportunity has come-a-knockin, and I just had to open that door. I have accepted a position as an advanced programmer at the <a href="http://www.c2experience.com/" title="The C2 Group" target="_blank">C2 Group</a> in Grandville, MI. Not only will I get to keep developing applications, but there is the added bonus of being closer to family. My wife and I will be living a lot closer to family as we await the birth of our first child.</p>

<p>I will be starting with C2 early next week on Monday the 23rd of January. I have decided to post this here not only to share the good news, but to give notice that I will be taking a tiny break from blogging for a week or so as I get everything in order for the big move. It is my goal to be ready to give 110% and come out of the gate strong at C2.</p>

<p>God has been extremely faithful to me and my family, and we are pumped to be setting out on this new journey He has placed before us.</p>
