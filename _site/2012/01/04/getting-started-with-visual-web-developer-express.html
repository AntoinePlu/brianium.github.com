					<h1>30 Days of ASP.NET: Getting Started With Visual Web Developer 2010 Express<span class="post-date">04 Jan 2012</span></h1>
					This first entry in the <a href="http://www.brianscaturro.com/series/30-days-of-asp-net/" target="_blank">"30 Days of ASP.NET"</a> covers a basic introduction to Visual Web Developer 2010 Express.

Visual Web Developer 2010 Express, VWD from here on out, is a feature rich <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> that has all of the tools you need to build ASP.NET applications. It is so feature rich and configurable that covering it in it's entirety would require a series of it's own. For now I am just going to cover some basics.

<h3>Getting VWD</h3>
Unlike the full Visual Studio suite, Visual Web Developer 2010 Express is free. You can download it <a target="blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-web-developer-express">here</a>.

<h3>Installing VWD</h3>
This step is just as easy as downloading VWD. Run the executable you downloaded, grab a cup of coffee/tea/beer, and relax. You will have an option to install SQL Server Express, and I recommend you install that as well if you plan on developing data driven apps.

<h3>Creating A Project in VWD</h3>
Fire up your brand new toy and you are greeted with the start page:
<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_2-e1325677778189.png" alt="" title="Screenshot_2" width="500" height="324" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1237" />

From here you can access recently worked on projects, create new projects, and get the latest ASP.NET news.

To start exploring the basics of the VWD landscape, go ahead and click the "New Project" button or go to <code>File > New Project</code>.

From here you should see a couple of options. I am going to be focusing on C#, so I will select that from the upper left under "Installed Templates", and I will select ASP.NET Web Application from the middle window. Leave the other settings where they are and click ok.

<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_3.png" alt="" title="Screenshot_3" width="504" height="258" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1239" />

<h3>Getting Familiar With the VWD Layout Settings</h3>
There are a couple of settings that will help you get started in VWD. There are three basic settings that will make tools available/unavailable based on your general needs. Go to <code>Tools > Settings.</code> There are "Basic Settings", "Code Only", and "Expert Settings". "Expert Settings" offer the broadest tool set and it is going to be the layout I will be working with. From here let's look at some of the VWD panels.

<h3>The Solution Explorer</h3>
The solution explorer shows up in the upper right by default. This is a complete overview of your application. It shows the source of your application, and also gives you an easy way to add new items to your application.
<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_3.jpg" alt="" title="solution explorer" width="215" height="627" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1251" />
I will demonstrate how a new item can be added to a project by adding a new "Web Form". It is as easy as right clicking the project name in the solution explorer and choosing <code>Add > New Item</code>. From here I will select "Web Form". There is now a new entry in your solution explorer at the bottom that says "WebForm1.aspx" if you used the default name when you added it.

<h3 style="clear:both">The Toolbox</h3>
The toolbox shows up on the left hand side of VWD by default. This is basically an area to store snippets and quick shortcuts you can drag into the main editor area.
<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_4.png" alt="" title="asp.net toolbox" width="183" height="326" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1241" /> 

Expand the "Standard" section in the toolbox and drag the server control called "Label" onto the main editor area between the div tags inside of the Web Form.

One other cool feature of the toolbox is the ability to create your own short snippets. Right click the toolbox and choose "Add Tab". Name the tab "Snippets". You can then drag content from the main editor into your toolbox section. Add an empty h1 tag to the body of the Web Form so the inside of the body element looks like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;form id="form1" runat="server"&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server" Text="Label"&gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;
</pre>

Highlight the empty h1 element and drag it into the "Snippets" section of your toolbox. You should now be able to drag your snippet onto the main editor whenever you need to do so.
<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_4.jpg" alt="" title="custom tool box" width="172" height="109" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1252" />

<h3 style="clear:both">The Properties Panel</h3>
The properties panel shows up in the lower right by default and is used to control the various properties (go figure) of the controls viewed in the editor area.
<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_5.png" alt="" title="Properties" width="213" height="355" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1245" />
To see this panel in action, click the tag for the control we dragged in from the toolbox section, the one that looks like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server" Text="Label"&gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt;
</pre>

Once you select it, the properties panel will be updated with the Label control's properties. Find the "Text" property under the "Appearance" section and update the default text (Label) to "Hello World"

<h3 style="clear:both">The Database Explorer</h3>
The database explorer is connected to the solution explorer and is used to manage database connections. Just be aware it is there when you start developing database driven applications.
<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_5.jpg" alt="" title="database explorer" width="209" height="331" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1253" />

<h3>The Error List</h3>
This guy comes in handy when it is time to run your application from VWD. It will give a list of errors and warnings in your project, and where you can find them. This is an extremely valuable tool, and it can be found at the bottom of the editor by default.

<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_6.jpg" alt="" title="error list" width="449" height="201" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1254" />

<h3>A Note on Modes</h3>
VWD comes with a few different modes you can develop in: design, split, and source. I typically stay in source mode, but design mode can be helpful for getting a quick glance at what things are looking like. Split mode is of course a combination of the two. You can switch to one of the three modes by heading to the lower left of the main editor area:

<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_7.jpg" alt="" title="mode switch" width="207" height="61" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1255" />

A quick glimpse of our application in design mode:
<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_8.jpg" alt="" title="design mode" width="531" height="232" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1256" />

<h3>Customizing and Resetting the Layout</h3>
It is worth a mention that you can totally customize where these various panels show up. It is as easy as clicking on the panel title and dragging it to the desired location. If you drag the panel without fixing it in a new location you can keep it as a floating window. If you feel like you want to restore your layout to it's default style you can go to the menu bar and click Window > Reset Window Layout. You can reset your toolbox customization by right clicking the toolbox and clicking "Reset Toolbox". The end all and be all of resets can be achieved by going to Tools > Settings > Import and Export then selecting "Reset All Settings"

<h3>Running Your App From VWD</h3>
This is one of the coolest features of any <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>, and VWD does it well. You can run your app with the built in web server to see how things are going. If you have any errors, the handy error list will show you whats wrong, and where to fix it. To run an application from VWD simply click the "Start Debugging" button in the toolbar under the main menu:
<img src="http://www.brianscaturro.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screenshot_9.jpg" alt="" title="start debugging" width="38" height="41" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1260" /> 
or press Ctrl + F5. Your default browser should open up and you should see your application in action!

<h3>Do These Tools Exist for Other Languages?</h3>
Microsoft did not invent the <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>. Visual Web Developer 2010 Express is a an extremely comprehensive tool. It supports it's framework of choice better than most. PHP offers a pretty awesome tool with <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/studio/" target="_blank">Zend Studio</a>. Java offers the well known <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> or <a href="http://netbeans.org/" target="_blank">NetBeans</a>. Ruby fans might gravitate towards <a href="http://aptana.com/products/studio3" target="_blank">Aptana Studio</a>. The point being, there are plenty of ways to be extremely productive in many languages (yes even for us who use text editors), and Visual Web Developer 2010 Express is the tool to do it in .NET.

<h3>Onward!</h3>
A review of a tool is not always the most thrilling, but revisiting concepts - no matter how basic - can be a good way to reinforce what you know, and teach others along the way. Next time I will be reviewing the basics of getting an ASP.NET Web Site up and running.
